Ladeau et al:

We used data from 228 North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS)8 routes across ten states (Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, Illinois, Colorado, Oregon) that represent WNV dispersal westward from the 1999 east coast introduction. We included routes that had at least 80% coverage from 1980 to 2005, and a maximum of two missing observations in years after WNV emergence. We selected 20 widespread and common North American bird species according to six criteria: (1) native to North America; (2) distribution includes New England/Mid-Atlantic states where WNV has been present the longest; (3) were regularly detected on BBS routes and in sufficient numbers along secondary roads, given habitat expectation and data; (4) breeding and vocalization season overlap with timing of BBS collection; (5) species for which some background information on susceptibility to WNV infection was available (Supplementary Table 1); and (6) chose species pool to cover the range of expected WNV impact. Finally, we randomly selected five additional species from the group that satisfied criteria 1–4 but that had not been studied in WNV infection experiments. This produced a total of 20 species, which was chosen as the number that we could efficiently model and evaluate.
